WPFoundationZurb
===============
A bare minimum Wordpress theme framework designed to speed up web development using both Foundation from Zurb  + HTML5Boilerplate with complete core HTML, CSS, and JS.  This is design with mobile first approach which includes grids, type, forms, navigation, and many more components. The goal here is to keep it minimal as much as possible. This is intended to use as a base theme framework to build custom or child theme quickly and easily.
